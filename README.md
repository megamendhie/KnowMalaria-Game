# KnowMalaria Game

**KnowMalaria** is a thrilling health awareness game designed to sensitize players on malaria prevention and control, but in an while entertaining way. The game is made up of three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium and Hard. The questions become more brain tasking as you progress through the levels. It also has a 50:50 option where the player can request for two of the wrong options to be removed, leaving one wrong option and the correct answer.

The app is developed for the InteDec team in collaboration with Department of Public Health, FUTO.
